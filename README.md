# Ecovacs Rest API

The problem:
I bought a Vaccum robot from Ecovacs brand (model Slim 2) and I would like to control it using Siri Shortcuts. In this case I choose to have a local server to control the robot.

Most of the work has been done by the creator of "Sucks.js", but I think with this simple server.js file it will be much easier for starters to run this library.

Thank you very much @joostth
